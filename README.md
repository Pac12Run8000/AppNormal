How to use AppNormal
======
Written in Xcode 7, this application was created using firebase, cocopods, swift and Xcode. It is a para-normal social networking app that allows users to share content and experiences with the entire audience of users or users can message each other directly.
1. Create a new login or login. 
2. Once logged In, you have the choice of tabs from a tabbar menu.

3. After you get to the main view with the TabBar controller, you will have the Tabbar option (at the botton of the view) that allow you to either "message" another user, view the "feed" or see the "terms and conditions". In order to "message" a user, click on a cell in the appropriate tableView controller and a message window will open up. You can message other users with text or images.

4. The feed tab allows you to see other people's posts. Once you select one of the posts, you can then comment, or like a pos. From the main "feed" controller you can also post to the feed.

5. From the terms of service controller you can see rules and constraints of service as well as the ability to report or flag content that violates the terms of service or code of conduct. BTW the "Admin" button is only seen by those with admin priveledges.
